At least 23 were people of      color. These are often hate crimes; homicides because of who these people      are and how they presented themselves in their lives. Often, these people      are misgendered and/or dead-named by local media and law enforcement,      disrespecting them in death.</p>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>    OBIT+ is a project that hopes to honor the memories of the victims of these    crimes by showcasing their names, photos, and stories, which is more than    the mainstream media has been doing for crimes of this category.<br>    The horizontal lines on the individual memorial pages represent the victim's    age, and the slight difference in the stroke color of the shapes on the    initial interface page indicates if the victim was a person of color. <br>    If the piece does not load the sound that should accompany the individual    memorial pages, try refreshing it a couple times. Just...be patient. I am    new to getting my interactive works online and am learning as I go! <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    If you see an incorrect piece of information within this piece or have    additional information you think should be included, do not hesitate to    email me.<br>    hadams30@pratt.edu <br>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>    <p style="margin-top: -24px; height: 27px;"><br>    </p>  </body></html>
